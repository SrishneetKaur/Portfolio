                        <p>In the bustling world of academia, paths are often uncertain, and choices can sometimes lead to the least expected outcomes we envision for ourselves. And so is my story...</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Hi! It's Srishneet, a college student who, in the beginning, never imagined herself delving into the world of technology. Born in a family without any strong ties to the tech realm and lacking elder siblings to guide me, I embarked on a journey that would redefine my academic trajectory.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Navigating through the tech landscape without familial guidance posed its share of challenges. The absence of a tech-savvy support system meant that every obstacle became a solo endeavor. However, undeterred by the lack of familial precedents (but not without several mental breakdowns), I pressed on, determined to do my best in the tech world.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I vividly recall the moment I wrote my first line of code, a modest 'hello world.' Though seemingly mundane, this simple act suddenly was one of my greatest achievements, filling me with pride and excitement. Little did I know, this small step marked the beginning of a challenging yet rewarding journey.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>As I gradually ventured into the realm of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), I encountered a maze of confusion. The myriad programming languages available left me in a state of indecision. The jumble of Python, Java, and C++ echoed in my mind, each presenting its own set of challenges and advantages. Nevertheless, I gradually found my footing, deciding ultimately to pursue CPP as my main language.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Balancing coursework with DSA became a high-stakes juggling act. As I strived for excellence in both realms, extracurricular activities beckoned, demanding a slice of my time. The struggle to allocate hours to programming, attend classes, and participate in clubs severely tested my time-management skills (as well as patience XD). Yet, through the chaos, and with the help of ample amounts of tea, I embraced each challenge as an opportunity for growth.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>However, even with my best efforts, the perfect balance remains elusive. Managing everything seamlessly is an ongoing struggle, an intricate dance with coursework, algorithms, and personal pursuits. Yet, I try. I try and fail... and try again. I persist, reminding myself every so often that perfection is a journey, not a destination.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The road ahead is still paved with lessons unlearned and challenges undiscovered, but I look to the future with enthusiasm. I may not have it all figured out, but I have faith that it'll work out. <i>I'll</i> work it out.The adventure unfolds, and with every keystroke, the best is yet to come.</p>
